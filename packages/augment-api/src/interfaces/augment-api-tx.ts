       * Note that the associated stash is still fully unbonded and chilled as a consequence of
       * calling [`Pallet::register_fast_unstake`]. Therefore, this should probably be followed
       * by a call to `rebond` in the staking system.

       * 
       * Some events from the staking and currency system might be emitted.

       * 
       * ## Details
       * 
       * The stash associated with the origin must have no ongoing unlocking chunks. If
       * successful, this will fully unbond and chill the stash. Then, it will enqueue the stash
       * to be checked in further blocks.
       * 
       * If by the time this is called, the stash is actually eligible for fast-unstake, then
       * they are guaranteed to remain eligible, because the call will chill them as well.
       * 
       * If the check works, the entire staking data is removed, i.e. the stash is fully
       * unstaked.
       * 
       * If the check fails, the stash remains chilled and waiting for being unbonded as in with
       * the normal staking system, but they lose part of their unbonding chunks due to consuming
       * the chain's resources.
       *
